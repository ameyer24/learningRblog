I started this blog to document and share my thoughts (and code!) as I learn more about data science and how it relates to academic libraries. When writing up my grant proposal, I focused on two important goals: that this would support student learning and that this would allow the Brandel Library to better manage existing data resources. I thought it would be helpful to explore both in greater detail.

# Student Learning and Data Literacy
A major focus of this project was building a capacity within the library to support and lead data literacy efforts on campus. Many course already use a variety of data sources in classroom instruction and in various assignments; creating a point person in the library would help better manage existing efforts and help inspire new efforts. An early focus will be on understanding existing needs - especially around Chicago data sources and census data - with a hope to expand that into general data literacy and numeracy.

# Library Usage Information
A second focus is on better managing and using library usage data. Right now, I'm working on project to better manage and use data in the following areas:

* Electronic Resources
* OPAC Search Logs
* Circulation Data
* Interlibrary Loan Requests

There are opportunities in all of these areas of improve user experience and increase operational efficiences by looking at data and using this data to inform change.

# Conclusion
Beyond these two stated goals, I've realized that there are a few more personal goals motivating this project. These personal motivations include:

* A desire to increase my analytical capacities. I'm very comfortable with a spreadsheet and think of myself as a power Excel user; this seems like a way that I can continue to extend myself and learn more.
* A general frustration with alternative tools. Excel is fine...but seems very limited and easily erodes to tons of manual data entry and is not very reproducible. Using R seems to solve these problems. Also frustrated with non-open tools that either cost a lot or money or impose restrictions. Again, R seems to solve these problems.
* A belief that librarians can better. I think really understanding and using data and statistics to make decisions is an area of growth for most libraries; I hope I can contribute something to that conversation.
