<p>In thinking about data science and library usage statistics, the first thing I wanted to tackle was Electronic Resources Usages statistics. There are many reasons that this seemed like a bad place to start:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don’t love the Counter standards and don’t think they tell a particularly interesting or complete story of our electronic resources usage.</li>
<li>Counter Reports are a pain to collect and analyze.</li>
<li>Our online resource financial information is scattered in several places with no complete or comprehensive system.</li>
</ul>
<p>But there are also reasons this would be a great place to start:</p>
<ul>
<li>Counter Reports (should) come in a standardized format making batch processes a possibility.</li>
<li>The problem of “too much data” is one that data science and tools like R can handle.</li>
<li>This would allow data structures, visualizations, and transformations to be shared among the library world; I could show off my good work and steal the best ideas from others.</li>
<li>Automating this work could remove some of the most hated parts of my job.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I started looking at electronic resource usage reports and financial information with the hope of transforming a mess of scattered usage reports and financial information into something that could help us understand our library usage and make more informed decisions about renewals and cancellations.</p>

<h2>Getting Started with the Tidyverse</h2>
<p>Like any good project, I learned by trial and error and lots of googling. Through this process I learned about the the set of R packages (and general approach to data science) known as the tidyverse. This diagram was in one of the first youtube videos I watched and it made a lot of sense to me and helped me organize my thoughts for this project.</p>

<p>This framework helped me divide my work into meaningful chunks. At it’s current stage, I’ve conceptualized this project in several discrete sections:</p>
<ol start="0" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Setup - setting up the files and loading the right R packages.</li>
<li>Import and Tidying - somehow get the data from various places into a standardized format within R.</li>
<li>Transformations - do stuff to the data; transform, summarize, average, etc.</li>
<li>Communication - boil down the data and transformations into meaningful reports that can be shared with other people.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m planning on writing longer posts about each stage of the project but wanted to provide this overview here.</p>
