<p>The setup file in my Electronic Resource report project is still a work in progress but it’s the logical place to start this reflection and tour. There are two main sections: a place to load packages that I will need later on as well as a place to define the folders I will use for data import and data export.</p>
<div id="loading-packages" class="section level2">
<h2>Loading Packages</h2>
<p>Here is the R code for this section:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(lubridate)
library(mosaic)
library(zoo)
library(scales)
library(knitr)</code></pre>
<p>The library function loads libraries that add new functions to base R. There are a lot of packages out there; I’m loading these because they are all required somewhere later in this project.</p>
</div>
<div id="setting-up-the-folders" class="section level2">
<h2>Setting up the Folders</h2>
<pre class="r"><code>input.folder &lt;- &quot;C:/DataScience/inputs&quot;
output.folder &lt;- &quot;C:/DataScience/outputs&quot;
DB1folder &lt;- &quot;C:/DataScience/inputs/DB1Reports&quot;
JR1folder &lt;- &quot;C:/DataScience/inputs/JR1Reports&quot;</code></pre>
<p>I’m still wondering if make specific definitions (like this) or setting up a working directory is the better way to specify where R should look for inputs and where it should look for outputs. I’ve defined these folders manually and that seems to make sense at the time; I might revisit this in the future and use a setwd() and make all of the folder pathways relative.</p>
</div>
