This article describes a project that used the statistical programming language R to generate reports about electronic usage and spending. This project had three main goals. First, to automate and systematize the process of gathering, compiling, and communicating data about electronic resource usage. Second, to increase library staff capacity for data science. Third, to provide a shareable framework and model for other libraries to use when dealing with data intensive projects. This project focused on electronic resource usage information in the form of Counter Reports but can be extended to manage and communicate data from a variety of other library systems or other data sources.

## Background
With library budgets shrinking and the cost of online resources growing, many libraries must critically examine electronic resource usage and related costs to make responsible collection development decisions. Yet gathering this information, making this data usable, and communicating relevant information is a difficult and labor intensive process. The context for this particular project is providing electronic resource usage information to other library staff to aid collection development decisions. However, this approach could be extended to deal with other data and communicate those results to a wide variety of stakeholders.

### R and the Tidyverse
R is an open source programming language freely available under the GNU General Public License. R excels in statistical computing and is growing in popularity across many disciplines. R enjoys a large and active user community as well as a number of packages that extend the basic functions of R. The growing popularity of R, the strong and active user community, the ability to do reproducible and rigorous data analysis, and the open nature of R make this an excellent option for many library applications. Furthermore, developing staff expertise in R may  position the library to take on additional roles in data management and create new connections on campus

The Tidyverse is set of R packages that “share a common philosophy of data and R programming and are designed to work together naturally.” ^[http://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html] The Tidyverse is a great place to begin learning R because these packages are widely adopted and relatively intuitive. There is also an abundance of high quality documentation that is freely available online.

### Counter Reports
COUNTER is a non-profit organization that provides libraries, publishers, and vendors a Code of Practice and set of definitions that facilitates the standard and consistent way to look at electronic resource usage. The project described in this paper focused on using the Database 1 reports generated under the fourth revision of Counter. However, the general approach outlined here could easily be extended to include other report types and/or reports from other revisions of the counter.

## Project Overview and General Overview
This project approaches data science following the model proposed by Hadley Wickham in R for Data Science. The code is divided and structured into three discrete stages:

1. Import and Tidy
2. Transform, Visualize, and Model
3. Communicate

![](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/data-science.png)

Following another tenet of the Tidyverse, this project has adopted a functional approach to R. This approach limits redundant code and makes the meaning of the code more transparent. In terms of style, the code is written for clarity and simplicity; it is not written to optimize performance. The hope is the the variable and function names as well as comments allow  others to easily use and adapt this code to their local institutional needs. Lastly, this project makes extensive use of the pipe function in R. As a core member of the Tidyverse, this function makes R code more readable and beautiful by combining complex operations without requiring nested functions. The book "R for Data Science" offers a very clear explanation of the pipe function.^[http://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html]

### Tidy Data
Before moving on, a note about terminology. In the context of the Tidyverse and throughout this paper, the word “tidy” carries a specific and technical definition. The goal of tidy data is to create an underlying structure that makes various types of transformation easier. Hadley Wickham offers this definition of tidy data:

"Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. A dataset is messy or tidy depending on how rows, columns and tables are matched up with observations, variables and types. In tidy data:

1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

Messy data is any other arrangement of the data."^[http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html]

According to this definition, COUNTER-compliant reports, although standardized, are messy because the structure of the data - the colunn and row arrangement - does not match correspond with the observations and variables. The process of tidying data begins by identifying the variables. For COUNTER-compliant database report 1, the variables are:

* Database
* Publisher
* Platform
* User Activity
* Date (expressed as Month-Year)
* Usage

This can be conveyed visually using the sample data provided by COUNTER.^[https://www.projectcounter.org/code-of-practice-sections/usage-reports] In this example, variables are circled in red and the observations are noted in the green box.

(screenshot)

Skipping the first 7 lines of the file, this data would look like this:
```{r echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
sampleDB1 <- as.data.frame(matrix(c("Database AA","Publisher X","Platform Z","Regular Searches",7814,2543,2267,3004,"Database AA","Publisher X","Platform Z","Searches-federated and automated",4889,1689,1589,1611,"Database AA","Publisher X","Platform Z","Result Clicks",12745,4022,3392,5331,"Database AA","Publisher X","Platform Z","Record Views",9585,3032,2777,3776,"Database BB","Publisher X","Platform Z","Regular Searches",3478,1098,1066,1314,"Database BB","Publisher X","Platform Z","Searches-federated and automated",2613,887,814,912,"Database BB","Publisher X","Platform Z","Result Clicks",5350,1776,1759,1815,"Database BB","Publisher X","Platform Z","Record Views",3595,1215,1066,1314),nrow=8,byrow=TRUE))
colnames(sampleDB1) <- c("Database","Publisher","Platform","User Activity","Reporting Period Total","Jan-2011","Feb-2011","Mar-2011")

kable(sampleDB1)
```

Conveying this data in a tidy dataframe would keep the Database, Publisher, Platform, and User Activity columns and add columns for Date and Usage.


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(zoo)
tidy.DB1reports <- function(df) {
  df %>%
    select(-c(5)) %>%
    gather(Date, Usage, -c(1:4)) %>%
    mutate(Usage = as.numeric(Usage))
}
tidyDB1 <- tidy.DB1reports(sampleDB1)
kable(tidyDB1)

```

The data in this table is tidy because all of the variables are in columns and each observation is a column.

### Setup
As a preliminary step, this project includes a file that sets up the rest of the process by loading the appropriate packages and by setting up the folder structure.
```{r Load Packages and Set Up Folders, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(lubridate)
library(mosaic)
library(zoo)
library(scales)
library(knitr)

# Setting up the folders
input.folder <- "C:/DataScience/inputs"
output.folder <- "C:/DataScience/outputs"
DB1folder <- "C:/DataScience/inputs/DB1Reports"
```

The `library` commands load the appropriate packages that are required in this project. The set up file explicitly names the input and output folders as well as the exact folder containing the Database Report 1 files. These explicit definitions are intended to make the code's functions and requirements clear and could be updated to match local system pathways. A better solution for advanced users might be to use the set working directory function - `setwd()` - but making these definitions explict and not relative seems to be easier to grasp.

### Import and Tidy
The first step of this project is to import the data from all the files folder defined above and create a single tidy dataframe in R. This process might be complicated by a variety of file formats and inconsistent data ranges. To address these problems, the functions in this project can handele COUNTER-compliant reports as both CSV and Excel files while providing a generalizable framework for other file types. The functions can also de-duplicate the usage data so that reports spanning overlapping date ranges will not cause problems. An area of improvement would be to improve handling of missing data. These functions are designed to work with Database Report 1 data but could easily be adapted to import and tidy other COUNTER-compliant reports.

#### Tidy the Data from Counter Reports
```{r echo=TRUE}
# Transforms data from the standard COUNTER-compliant report to a tidy dataframe.
tidy.DB1reports <- function(df) {
  df %>%
    select(-c(5)) %>%
    gather(Date, Usage, -c(1:4)) %>%
    mutate(Date = as.yearmon(Date, "%b-%Y")) %>%
    mutate(Usage = as.numeric(Usage)) %>%
    rename("User_Activity" = "User Activity")
}
```
This function transform data from a COUNTER-compliant format to a tidy dataframe. Looking at each line in detail:

1. `select(-c(5))` - This line deletes the 5th column. The Reporting Period Total is not useful within the "Tidyverse" and is therefore removed.
2. `gather(Date, Usage, -c(1:4))` - The `gather` function is the primary way of moving data from a "wide" format into a tidy "long" format. This step keeps the data in columns 1-4 by collapses all the other columns in key-value pairs. This function create new variables for the key and value; for COUNTER-compliant reports, the key is the "Date" variable and the value is the "Usage" variable.
3. `mutate(Date = as.yearmon(Date, "%b-%Y"))` The `mutate` function adds a new varible from existing variables; here we update the "Date" variable by converting that data from a simple character string to the Year-Mon data type.
4. `mutate(Usage = as.numeric(Usage))` - Similarly, this function converts the Usage data from a character to numeric. 
5. `rename("User_Activity" = "User Activity")` - Lastly, this function renames the "User Activity" column to avoid the space in the column name; this is probably optional but made life easier while working with the data.

#### Import the Data from the Files

The function above transforms a dataframe within R; these functions load the data from a specific file and then apply the `tidy.DB1reports` function defined above.

```{r echo=TRUE}
# This function imports data from CSV files and makes that data tidy.
csv.importer <- function(file) {
  file %>%
    read_csv(skip=7, col_names = TRUE) %>%
    tidy.DB1reports()
}
# This function imports data from Excel files and makes that data tidy.
excel.importer <- function(file) {
  file %>%
    read_excel(skip=7, col_names = TRUE) %>%
    tidy.DB1reports()
}
```

These functions accept a single file as a parameter and import that data by calling the approriate reading function. Both processes skip the first 7 lines because those lines do not contain relevant information for this analysis and then tidy the data using the function defined above. It is somewhat inelegant to have two functions that do essentially the same thing but keeping the two function separate improves the readability of the code and is effective, conceptually simple, and easily extendable. A generalized import function would also be an improvement.

#### Loading and Tidying
This phase of the project now has functions that can load a file and tidy the data; we now need a function that can apply these functions to all the files in a given folder.

```{r echo=TRUE}
# These functions load DB1 reports from a given folder.
load.DB1.csv <- function(path) { 
  csv.files <- dir(path, pattern = "*.(CSV|csv)", full.names = TRUE)
  tables <- lapply(csv.files, csv.importer)
  do.call(rbind, tables)
}

load.DB1.excel <- function(path) { 
  excel.files <- dir(path, pattern = "*.(XL*|xl*)", full.names = TRUE)
  tables <- lapply(excel.files, excel.importer)
  do.call(rbind, tables)
}
```

These functions accept a path to a folder as a parameter and then create a list of file names for files that match a particular pattern. The second line applies the appropriate import function to the list of files. Lastly, the `do.call(rbind, tables)` line binds together these tables by row.

#### The Tidy Dataframe
At last, we have the functions needed to import data from every CSV and Excel file in a specified folder and create a single tidy dataframe in R.

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
DB1.data.csv <- load.DB1.csv(DB1folder)
DB1.data.excel <- load.DB1.excel(DB1folder)

DB1 <- unique(rbind(DB1.data.csv,DB1.data.excel))
```

The first two steps create two separate dataframes call `DB1.data.csv` and `DB1.data.excel` that contain the data from the respective file formats. The final line combines the data into in a single dataframe called DB1. The `unique` operation deletes any duplicate observations that may be present in the original usage reports.

### Transform, Visualize, and Model

After importing and tidying the usage data into R, the next step was to transform, visualize, and model this data. Right now, this project performs basic transformations such as filtering, summarizing, and graphing the data. However, given the tidy structure of the data and the powerful tools that R provides for data transformation, there is an opportunity to build functions that radically transformation the data and that allow for new insights. Additionally, given the shared data structures and tools, there are opportunites to share these transformation and visualizations freely and create new sets of best practices

Like the import and tidy process, this project uses a functional approach to handle transformations and visualizations. The majority of these functions perform transformations on the tidy dataframe created earlier without changing or updating that original dataframe. Rather than exhaustively surveying all possible transformations, this paper will highlight a single function that will demonstrate the basic structure of this part of the process, the power and opportunities to visualize and transform data, and the relative ease of writing functions in R.

This function transforms usage data by isolating data for a single database over a specified period of time, summarizing that data based on the academic calendar, and creating a bar graph of that data.

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Graphs database usage based on academic term.
usage.graph.database.acad.term <- function(DatabaseName,
                                           StartYear,
                                           EndYear,
                                           Action = all.actions){
  DB1 %>%
    # filters based on database name, date, and user activity
    filter(Database %in% DatabaseName) %>%
    filter(Date >= StartYear, Date <= EndYear) %>%
    filter(User_Activity %in% Action) %>%
    # creates new variables "Year" and "Month" from the date field.
    mutate(Year = year(Date), Month=month(Date)) %>%
    # creates new variable "Academic_Term" based on the month data.
    mutate(Academic_Term = derivedFactor(
      "Spring" = (Month==1 | Month==2  | Month==3  | Month==4),
      "Summer" = (Month==5 | Month==6  | Month==7  | Month==8),
      "Fall"   = (Month==9 | Month==10 | Month==11 | Month==12)
    )) %>%
    group_by(Database, User_Activity, Academic_Term, Year) %>%
    summarize(Usage=sum(Usage)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = Academic_Term, y = Usage)) +
    geom_bar(aes(fill=factor(Year)),
             stat="identity",
             position = position_dodge()) +
    scale_fill_discrete(name="Year") +
    xlab("Academic Term") +
    ylab("Usage")
}
```

This function accepts four parameters - database name, start year, end year, and action - and applies these parameters as filters to the tidy dataframe. These filters return only observations matching the parameters. The action parameter is optional and defaults to all actions through a variable defined earlier.

The `mutate` function creates new variables from existing variables. In this case, the `mutate` function creates three new variables from the existing date information: Year, Month, and Academic Term. Strictly speaking it was not necessary to create a new variable for month - the Academic Term could be derived directly from the date - but it has been included in the hopes that it makes the code more accessible. The `mutate` function that creates the Academic Term variable uses the `derivedFactor` from the Mosaic package.

Thus far, the function has filtered out unwanted observations and created three new variables from the date field. The next steps group the data and then summarize the usage data by summing based on academic term.

The final section, beginning with the call to the `ggplot` function, plots the now summarized data on a graph. This function comes from the ggplot2 package and is a core member of the Tidyverse. ggplot is able to create publication quality graphics from a relatively simple set of options that are infinitely customizable.

This functions creates a base layer of the summarized data and sets the aesthetic properties for the entire graph; the Academic Term on the x axis and the Usage on the y axis. The next layer creates a bar graph; the color of the bars will be determined by the Year, the stat=identity does something important, and the position will be dodge (i.e. not stacked). The last three commands add some features such as labels.

In a few short lines, this function has transformed the usage data into a professional and easily interpreted visualization that shows changes in usage by semester. Creating a comparable graph in Excel, on the other hand, would have been a very laborious and time consuming process. Furthermore, this function can be updated to apply to a different database, extend over different date ranges, or used by any other library that has library usage data in a tidy format.

### Communicate

To accomplish the final stage of the process - communicating results to an extra audience - this project uses the package R Markdown. R Markdown documents can execute R code and create reports in a variety of file formats including Word, PDF, and HTML. These reports can mix text, R code, and the results of R code - graphs or tables - and offer some formatting options to create professional and polished reports.

This project's R Markdown file begins by calling all the previous files as a `source`. This allows the R Markdown document to use the underlying data and all of the functions defined in earlier files. Next, because this project hopes to generate standard reports for a many different databases, the document specifies a database and data ranges at the beginning of the document. With these definitions in place, the rest of the document can call and execute R code without the need for repetitive data entry or customization. For example, updating the report to cover a different date range or report on a different database requires changing a single variable. Generating the same report on a regular basis is trivially simple; simply add the data in the source folder and re-run the report to import and include new information.

So far, this project has focused on automating and standardizing reports to save time and energy. However, this same package and features could also be used to create highly customized and specific reports that are narrowly tailored for a particular audience. R Markdown and R generally is suited to creating highly standardized reports through automated processes or allowing deep exploration of unique datasets and communicate specific messages though custom reports.

## Conclusion
Using R and the Tidyverse to generate library usage reports has many clear advantages relative to alternative methods. Automating the reporting process for electronic resource usage has the potential to save hours of staff time and create standardized reports that allow for better collection development decisions. Creating transformations and visualizations also has the ability to create new insights and raise new questions.

Additionally, this approach provides the library with many new opportunities. Learning and using R for data projects builds capacity for other data projects and collaborations across campus. Using an free, open source language allows allows libraries to build and share data structures, transformations, and visualizations. The programming language R is powerful enough to recreate any data transformation and is much more shareable than data manipulation done in spreadsheets or in proprietary software. Lastly, R has the ability to combine data from a variety of sources. Data from circulation transactions, gate counts, computer usage, and head counts could be combined to get a more comprehensive sense of library usage.
