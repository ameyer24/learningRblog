<p>This article describes a project that used the statistical programming language R to generate reports about electronic usage and spending. This project had three main goals. First, to automate and systematize the process of gathering, compiling, and communicating data about electronic resource usage. Second, to increase library staff capacity for data science. Third, to provide a shareable framework and model for other libraries to use when dealing with data intensive projects. This project focused on electronic resource usage information in the form of Counter Reports but can be extended to manage and communicate data from a variety of other library systems or other data sources.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>With library budgets shrinking and the cost of online resources growing, many libraries must critically examine electronic resource usage and related costs to make responsible collection development decisions. Yet gathering this information, making this data usable, and communicating relevant information is a difficult and labor intensive process. The context for this particular project is providing electronic resource usage information to other library staff to aid collection development decisions. However, this approach could be extended to deal with other data and communicate those results to a wide variety of stakeholders.</p>
<div id="r-and-the-tidyverse" class="section level3">
<h3>R and the Tidyverse</h3>
<p>R is an open source programming language freely available under the GNU General Public License. R excels in statistical computing and is growing in popularity across many disciplines. R enjoys a large and active user community as well as a number of packages that extend the basic functions of R. The growing popularity of R, the strong and active user community, the ability to do reproducible and rigorous data analysis, and the open nature of R make this an excellent option for many library applications. Furthermore, developing staff expertise in R may position the library to take on additional roles in data management and create new connections on campus</p>
<p>The Tidyverse is set of R packages that “share a common philosophy of data and R programming and are designed to work together naturally.” <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The Tidyverse is a great place to begin learning R because these packages are widely adopted and relatively intuitive. There is also an abundance of high quality documentation that is freely available online.</p>

<div id="counter-reports" class="section level3">
<h3>Counter Reports</h3>
<p>COUNTER is a non-profit organization that provides libraries, publishers, and vendors a Code of Practice and set of definitions that facilitates the standard and consistent way to look at electronic resource usage. The project described in this paper focused on using the Database 1 reports generated under the fourth revision of Counter. However, the general approach outlined here could easily be extended to include other report types and/or reports from other revisions of the counter.</p>

<h2>Project Overview and General Overview</h2>
<p>This project approaches data science following the model proposed by Hadley Wickham in R for Data Science. The code is divided and structured into three discrete stages:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Import and Tidy</li>
<li>Transform, Visualize, and Model</li>
<li>Communicate</li>
</ol>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>Following another tenet of the Tidyverse, this project has adopted a functional approach to R. This approach limits redundant code and makes the meaning of the code more transparent. In terms of style, the code is written for clarity and simplicity; it is not written to optimize performance. The hope is the the variable and function names as well as comments allow others to easily use and adapt this code to their local institutional needs. Lastly, this project makes extensive use of the pipe function in R. As a core member of the Tidyverse, this function makes R code more readable and beautiful by combining complex operations without requiring nested functions. The book “R for Data Science” offers a very clear explanation of the pipe function.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<div id="tidy-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Tidy Data</h3>
<p>Before moving on, a note about terminology. In the context of the Tidyverse and throughout this paper, the word “tidy” carries a specific and technical definition. The goal of tidy data is to create an underlying structure that makes various types of transformation easier. Hadley Wickham offers this definition of tidy data:</p>
<p>“Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. A dataset is messy or tidy depending on how rows, columns and tables are matched up with observations, variables and types. In tidy data:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Each variable forms a column.</li>
<li>Each observation forms a row.</li>
<li>Each type of observational unit forms a table.</li>
</ol>
<p>Messy data is any other arrangement of the data.“<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>According to this definition, COUNTER-compliant reports, although standardized, are messy because the structure of the data - the column and row arrangement - does not match correspond with the observations and variables. The process of tidying data begins by identifying the variables. For COUNTER-compliant database report 1, the variables are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Database</li>
<li>Publisher</li>
<li>Platform</li>
<li>User Activity</li>
<li>Date (expressed as Month-Year)</li>
<li>Usage</li>
</ul>
<p>This can be conveyed visually using the sample data provided by COUNTER.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> In this example, variables are circled in red and the observations are noted in the green box.</p>

</table>
<p>The data in this table is tidy because all of the variables are in columns and each observation is a column.</p>
</div>
<div id="setup" class="section level3">
<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>As a preliminary step, this project includes a file that sets up the rest of the process by loading the appropriate packages and by setting up the folder structure.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(lubridate)
library(mosaic)
library(zoo)
library(scales)
library(knitr)

# Setting up the folders
input.folder &lt;- &quot;C:/DataScience/inputs&quot;
output.folder &lt;- &quot;C:/DataScience/outputs&quot;
DB1folder &lt;- &quot;C:/DataScience/inputs/DB1Reports&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The <code>library</code> commands load the appropriate packages that are required in this project. The set up file explicitly names the input and output folders as well as the exact folder containing the Database Report 1 files. These explicit definitions are intended to make the code’s functions and requirements clear and could be updated to match local system pathways. A better solution for advanced users might be to use the set working directory function - <code>setwd()</code> - but making these definitions explicit and not relative seems to be easier to grasp.</p>
</div>
<div id="import-and-tidy" class="section level3">
<h3>Import and Tidy</h3>
<p>The first step of this project is to import the data from all the files folder defined above and create a single tidy dataframe in R. This process might be complicated by a variety of file formats and inconsistent data ranges. To address these problems, the functions in this project can handle COUNTER-compliant reports as both CSV and Excel files while providing a generalizable framework for other file types. The functions can also de-duplicate the usage data so that reports spanning overlapping date ranges will not cause problems. An area of improvement would be to improve handling of missing data. These functions are designed to work with Database Report 1 data but could easily be adapted to import and tidy other COUNTER-compliant reports.</p>
<div id="tidy-the-data-from-counter-reports" class="section level4">
<h4>Tidy the Data from Counter Reports</h4>
<pre class="r"><code># Transforms data from the standard COUNTER-compliant report to a tidy dataframe.
tidy.DB1reports &lt;- function(df) {
  df %&gt;%
    select(-c(5)) %&gt;%
    gather(Date, Usage, -c(1:4)) %&gt;%
    mutate(Date = as.yearmon(Date, &quot;%b-%Y&quot;)) %&gt;%
    mutate(Usage = as.numeric(Usage)) %&gt;%
    rename(&quot;User_Activity&quot; = &quot;User Activity&quot;)
}</code></pre>
<p>This function transform data from a COUNTER-compliant format to a tidy dataframe. Looking at each line in detail:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>select(-c(5))</code> - This line deletes the 5th column. The Reporting Period Total is not useful within the “Tidyverse” and is therefore removed.</li>
<li><code>gather(Date, Usage, -c(1:4))</code> - The <code>gather</code> function is the primary way of moving data from a “wide” format into a tidy “long” format. This step keeps the data in columns 1-4 by collapses all the other columns in key-value pairs. This function create new variables for the key and value; for COUNTER-compliant reports, the key is the “Date” variable and the value is the “Usage” variable.</li>
<li><code>mutate(Date = as.yearmon(Date, &quot;%b-%Y&quot;))</code> The <code>mutate</code> function adds a new variable from existing variables; here we update the “Date” variable by converting that data from a simple character string to the Year-Mon data type.</li>
<li><code>mutate(Usage = as.numeric(Usage))</code> - Similarly, this function converts the Usage data from a character to numeric.</li>
<li><code>rename(&quot;User_Activity&quot; = &quot;User Activity&quot;)</code> - Lastly, this function renames the “User Activity” column to avoid the space in the column name; this is probably optional but made life easier while working with the data.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="import-the-data-from-the-files" class="section level4">
<h4>Import the Data from the Files</h4>
<p>The function above transforms a dataframe within R; these functions load the data from a specific file and then apply the <code>tidy.DB1reports</code> function defined above.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># This function imports data from CSV files and makes that data tidy.
csv.importer &lt;- function(file) {
  file %&gt;%
    read_csv(skip=7, col_names = TRUE) %&gt;%
    tidy.DB1reports()
}
# This function imports data from Excel files and makes that data tidy.
excel.importer &lt;- function(file) {
  file %&gt;%
    read_excel(skip=7, col_names = TRUE) %&gt;%
    tidy.DB1reports()
}</code></pre>
<p>These functions accept a single file as a parameter and import that data by calling the appropriate reading function. Both processes skip the first 7 lines because those lines do not contain relevant information for this analysis and then tidy the data using the function defined above. It is somewhat inelegant to have two functions that do essentially the same thing but keeping the two function separate improves the readability of the code and is effective, conceptually simple, and easily extendable. A generalized import function would also be an improvement.</p>
</div>
<div id="loading-and-tidying" class="section level4">
<h4>Loading and Tidying</h4>
<p>This phase of the project now has functions that can load a file and tidy the data; we now need a function that can apply these functions to all the files in a given folder.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># These functions load DB1 reports from a given folder.
load.DB1.csv &lt;- function(path) { 
  csv.files &lt;- dir(path, pattern = &quot;*.(CSV|csv)&quot;, full.names = TRUE)
  tables &lt;- lapply(csv.files, csv.importer)
  do.call(rbind, tables)
}

load.DB1.excel &lt;- function(path) { 
  excel.files &lt;- dir(path, pattern = &quot;*.(XL*|xl*)&quot;, full.names = TRUE)
  tables &lt;- lapply(excel.files, excel.importer)
  do.call(rbind, tables)
}</code></pre>
<p>These functions accept a path to a folder as a parameter and then create a list of file names for files that match a particular pattern. The second line applies the appropriate import function to the list of files. Lastly, the <code>do.call(rbind, tables)</code> line binds together these tables by row.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-tidy-dataframe" class="section level4">
<h4>The Tidy Dataframe</h4>
<p>At last, we have the functions needed to import data from every CSV and Excel file in a specified folder and create a single tidy dataframe in R.</p>
<p>The first two steps create two separate dataframes call <code>DB1.data.csv</code> and <code>DB1.data.excel</code> that contain the data from the respective file formats. The final line combines the data into in a single dataframe called DB1. The <code>unique</code> operation deletes any duplicate observations that may be present in the original usage reports.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="transform-visualize-and-model" class="section level3">
<h3>Transform, Visualize, and Model</h3>
<p>After importing and tidying the usage data into R, the next step was to transform, visualize, and model this data. Right now, this project performs basic transformations such as filtering, summarizing, and graphing the data. However, given the tidy structure of the data and the powerful tools that R provides for data transformation, there is an opportunity to build functions that radically transformation the data and that allow for new insights. Additionally, given the shared data structures and tools, there are opportunities to share these transformation and visualizations freely and create new sets of best practices</p>
<p>Like the import and tidy process, this project uses a functional approach to handle transformations and visualizations. The majority of these functions perform transformations on the tidy dataframe created earlier without changing or updating that original dataframe. Rather than exhaustively surveying all possible transformations, this paper will highlight a single function that will demonstrate the basic structure of this part of the process, the power and opportunities to visualize and transform data, and the relative ease of writing functions in R.</p>
<p>This function transforms usage data by isolating data for a single database over a specified period of time, summarizing that data based on the academic calendar, and creating a bar graph of that data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Graphs database usage based on academic term.
usage.graph.database.acad.term &lt;- function(DatabaseName,
                                           StartYear,
                                           EndYear,
                                           Action = all.actions){
  DB1 %&gt;%
    # filters based on database name, date, and user activity
    filter(Database %in% DatabaseName) %&gt;%
    filter(Date &gt;= StartYear, Date &lt;= EndYear) %&gt;%
    filter(User_Activity %in% Action) %&gt;%
    # creates new variables &quot;Year&quot; and &quot;Month&quot; from the date field.
    mutate(Year = year(Date), Month=month(Date)) %&gt;%
    # creates new variable &quot;Academic_Term&quot; based on the month data.
    mutate(Academic_Term = derivedFactor(
      &quot;Spring&quot; = (Month==1 | Month==2  | Month==3  | Month==4),
      &quot;Summer&quot; = (Month==5 | Month==6  | Month==7  | Month==8),
      &quot;Fall&quot;   = (Month==9 | Month==10 | Month==11 | Month==12)
    )) %&gt;%
    group_by(Database, User_Activity, Academic_Term, Year) %&gt;%
    summarize(Usage=sum(Usage)) %&gt;%
    ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Usage)) +
    geom_bar(aes(fill=factor(Year)),
             stat=&quot;identity&quot;,
             position = position_dodge()) +
    facet_grid(. ~ Academic_Term) +
    xlab(&quot;Academic Term&quot;) +
    ylab(&quot;Usage&quot;)
}</code></pre>
<p>This function accepts four parameters: database name, start year, end year, and action. It uses these parameters as filters to the tidy dataframe by returning only observations that match the parameters. The action parameter is optional and defaults to all actions through a variable defined earlier.</p>
<p>As noted earlier, the <code>mutate</code> function creates new variables from existing variables. In this case, the <code>mutate</code> function creates three new variables from the existing date information: Year, Month, and Academic Term. Strictly speaking it was not necessary to create a new variable for month - the Academic Term could be derived directly from the date - but it has been included in the hopes that it makes the code more accessible. The <code>mutate</code> function that creates the Academic Term variable uses the <code>derivedFactor</code> function from the Mosaic package. The last transformation of the data was to group the data and then summarize the usage data based on academic term.</p>
<p>The final section, beginning with the call to the <code>ggplot</code> function, plots the now summarized data on a graph. This function comes from the ggplot2 package, a core member of the Tidyverse, that is able to create publication quality graphics from a relatively simple set of options and layers.</p>
<p>The graphing function creates a base layer and sets the aesthetic properties for the entire graph with Year on the x axis and the Usage data on the y axis. The next layer creates a bar graph; the color of the bars will be determined by the Year and the statistic to graph is the identity. We also want a faceted graph; one bar graph for each Academic Term. The final two commands add labels to the x and y axis.</p>
<p>In a few short lines, this function has transformed the tidy usage data into a high quality graph that shows usage data by academic term. Creating a comparable graph in Excel is possible but the advantages of R are clear. This function exists apart from the actual data; that means that the usage data can be updated and the function can simply be re-run on the updated data set creating consistent graphs over time. Similarly, this same function be used to updated to examine a different database or different date range. Lastly, using a shared vocabulary allows for libraries to develop and share transformations and create best practices for domain-specific usage data.</p>

<p>The final stage in the model and the last step in this project is to communicate the results. For this part of the process, this project uses the R Markdown package. R Markdown can combine text, R code, and the results of R code such as graphs and tables and output the results in a variety of file formats including Word, PDF, and HTML. R Markdown also offers formatting options and customized themes that can create professional and polished reports.</p>
<p>This project’s R Markdown file begins by calling all the previous files as a <code>source</code>. This allows the R Markdown document to use the underlying data and all of the functions defined in earlier files. Next, because this project hopes to generate a standard reports for a many different databases, the document specifies a database and data ranges at the beginning of the document. With these definitions in place, the rest of the R Markdown document can call and execute R code without the need for repetitive data entry; updating the database variable at the beginning of the report updates the entire report. This makes generating the same report on a regular basis simple; add new data in the specified folder and re-run the report to include the new data.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Using R and the Tidyverse to generate library usage reports has many clear advantages relative to alternative methods. Automating the reporting process for electronic resource usage has the potential to save hours of staff time and create standardized reports that allow for better collection development decisions. Transforming and visualizing this data has the potential to create new insights and raise new questions.</p>
<p>Beyond improving this particular process, using R and the Tidyverse provides the library with many other benefits and new opportunities. Learning and using R for data projects builds capacity for other data projects and collaborations across campus. Using an free, open source language allows allows libraries to build and share data structures, transformations, and visualizations. The programming language R is powerful enough to recreate any data transformation and is much more shareable than data manipulation done in spreadsheets or in proprietary software. Lastly, R has the ability to combine data from a variety of sources. Data from circulation transactions, gate counts, computer usage, and head counts could be combined to get a more comprehensive sense of library usage.</p>
<p>R is a free and open language that is growing in popularity. This article shares one library’s limited experience using R to automate electronic resource usage reports but also argues that the opportunities and advantages for the library community are strong and clear.</p>
